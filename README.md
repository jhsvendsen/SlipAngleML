# SlipAngleML
Trying to approximate slip angles from other parameters using a machine learning model

OBS: This is working progress!

Data obtained:
I used assetto corsa to create the data. I used the self-driving function to drive the large amount of desired laps.

Attempted Models so far:

- NN
- RNN
